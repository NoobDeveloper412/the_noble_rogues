      "Through this arch, coal used for heating the house would be poured into the basement for storage. This detail of the house, designed by architect Juozas Milvydas, was so elegant and modern that neighbors building new houses nearby later copied it. The coal would be carried to the boiler room, which was also intended as a shelter in case of war because it's located in the chimney area—the sturdiest part of the building and the safest place if the city were bombed.",

      "Comfortable soft armchairs for guests are placed here, and there is a piano against the wall. Sugihara enjoys playing it, although he always plays the same melody. But he plays it perfectly. Sliding doors separate the living room from the dining room. During receptions, the doors could be pulled back, turning the living room and dining room into one large room.",

        "Sending diplomatic letters by mail, such as to Japan, would take a very long time, as the mail was transported by ships. Instead, messages were telegraphed, and to keep the information confidential, the messages were encrypted. For instance, you might receive a message like QZMLEMJPGEZ. Using a 'key' for the fonts, you turn the encryption machine’s rotors according to the code. When you press the Q key, a light indicating the letter V lights up, and by doing this letter by letter, you decode the message and read: ALLISWELL`,
