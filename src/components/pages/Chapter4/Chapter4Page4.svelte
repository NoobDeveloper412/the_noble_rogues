      That’s how we got to know each other. Chiune visited us so often that he
      almost became a family member, another brother listening to my chatter.
      His attention baffled me, a simple girl: he had already been Deputy
      Minister of Foreign Affairs in Manchuria before arriving in Tokyo.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-8">
      Unbelievably brave and stubborn: just imagine, he disobeyed his own
      father! He deliberately failed the medical entrance exams because he
      wanted to study English. After graduating from Nagoya Lyceum, he entered
      Waseda University and joined the Christian Baptist Brotherhood to learn
      English more quickly. As his father refused to give him money, he had to
      work along with studying.

    <p class="mt-8">
      Once, delivering parcels, he saw an announcement that the State Department
      was looking for students. They explained to him at the ministry that right
      now Russian-speaking students were being sought instead of English. And
      so? The nineteen-year-old goes to Manchuria, enrolls at Harbin University,
      comes to live with a family of White Russians who have escaped the
      revolution, and learns the language in a flash. He immediately adopts the
      Orthodox faith and marries Klaudia Semionova Apollonova, and from now on
      can be called Pavlov Sergeyevich. He speaks Manchurian, English, Russian,
      German and French perfectly.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-8">
      He served in the army. Worked as a Russian language teacher. He gave
      lectures to students on Soviet politics and the economic situation. He
      discussed with the Soviet Union about the railway in northern Manchuria.
      And what happened after that? He “couldn't stand the cruelty towards the
      local Chinese population and returned to Tokyo”, was it so?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-8">
      Some stories of his life are still unclear to me - for example, why did he
      divorce his wife? But it’s not my business anyway.
