    up. When your father is the director of the Kagawa Lyceum, <span

    means you have a huge library at home, and I used to devour all the books in
    it. I remember very difficult lyceum exams, when to relax my brain I began writing

    in Japan, she was the first of all women to buy one for herself; when
    high-heeled shoes came into fashion - she kicked away her slippers and even
    wore them around the house.
