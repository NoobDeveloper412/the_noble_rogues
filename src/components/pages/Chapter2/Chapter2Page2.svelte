      A family as any other. If you asked me about Aaron, my older brother, I
      would first say that he is in love with Eliza, the bookshop girl, and only
      then would I add that he is a Yeshiva student, for you could see him much
      more often by the bookshop window than at his desk.

    <p class="mt-8">
      My little brother Tolik is only four, always clutching at Mom’s skirt or
      sitting in Grandma’s bed, happily listening to fairy tales. My mother -
      who is a beauty even with Tolik clinging to her skirt - always smiles, and
      if you see her biting her lip, you can be sure that a storm is approaching
      and whoever gets caught in it won’t meet a lucky end.

      Dad knows best how to calm Mom’s storms, I think that’s what dads are for
      - to make moms smile.
