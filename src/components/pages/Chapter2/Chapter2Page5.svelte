      Dad, who started sitting at the radio longer and longer, finally turned it
      off and said to Mom, his lips a grayish tint: let's go, darling, let's
      move to America, I have acquaintances there. They say they would help to
      rent a jewellery shop on a very good street, our kids are good at
      languages, they adapt quickly, I would enroll them in the best schools,
      letâ€™s go, sweetheart, I beg you.
