        The first floor is full of muted sounds: the clickety clack of the
        typewriter in Sugihara’s office, the occasional ring-ring-ring of the
        phone. Two Poles are quietly arguing in the Assistants’ room, I can hear
        the names of the cities: "Stockholm... Japanese Consulate in Finland...
        Polish section of the British Consulate" - nothing that could interest a
        cat.

        The Decoding room is much more intriguing, it’s forbidden to go there,
        but I wait for Gudze to sneak into that room, then dart through his legs
        and hide under the curtain that falls to the ground. Gudze, walking
        softly as a cat, approaches the table. The table is gently buzzing,
        wires are tangled everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        At night I hear beeping noises coming out of this room, I used to
        suspect the birds, but there are no birds around: only some radios,
        telegraph handles, headphones, a thing that looks like a typewriter,
        only full of wires, also some plugs and stinky hot light bulbs.

        Japanese Chiune Sugihara told the Lithuanian press that he came here to
        strengthen Lithuanian-Japanese cultural ties, and also to represent
        Osram light bulb firm, but I don't see any light bulb boxes for sale -
        or any ties, for that matter: only tangled wires. Gudze is hurriedly
        rummaging between round cards mottled with letters, writes something
        down and hides it in a pocket of his jacket. Sitting under the dusty
        curtain, I can’t suppress a sneeze. “ACHOO!"

      <p class="text-primary-300">
        Frightened, Gudze jumps in the air and turns around.
