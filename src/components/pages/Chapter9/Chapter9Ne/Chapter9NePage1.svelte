    <p>
      Dad refuses to be a Soviet spy and to sign a cooperation agreement. And so
      our whole family, except Aaron, who has already left - although we have a
      transit visa for Japan, although we have money for train tickets - have no
      right to leave the Soviet Union.
      <br /><br />
      Dad is taken away in an unknown direction, and Tolik, Mom and I stay in Vilnius.
      Then the Soviet government is replaced by the Nazi government, and we, having
      avoided the Łódź ghetto, enter the Vilnius Jewish ghetto instead.
