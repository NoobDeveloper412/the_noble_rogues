          For Jan Zwartendijk, things turned a little less happy. He never told
          anyone about the events in Lithuania. Leaving Kaunas, he burned all the
          lists of the visas he issued. In 1964, he received a strict reprimand -
          instead of award - from the Dutch authorities for counterfeiting visas.
          Jan Zwartendijk never found out how many Jewish lives he had saved. Only
          on 15 September, 1976, a letter came from Israel to Eindhoven stating
          that 95 percent of the Jews he saved - 2132 people - had survived the
          war. The saddest thing is that Jan Zwartendijk died on September 14 of
          that same year. The good news came one day too late.
